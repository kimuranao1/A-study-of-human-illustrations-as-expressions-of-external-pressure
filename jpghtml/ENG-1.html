<h1>This is an example of AI output. </h1>
<p>
It's a typical drawing of a girl. She has blonde hair and a black, witch-like decoration.
</p>
<h1>So, when you look at this "ordinary drawing of a girl you might see somewhere,"
do you feel the gaze of the girl character?
</h1>
<p>
Do you feel like you're being subjected to the power of that gaze?
Do you feel like the girl is looking at you?
I don't evoke those feelings from this drawing.
</p>
<p></p>
<h1>This girl is the one being "seen," not the one "staring."
</h1>
<p>
That's how it was written.
How do we know that?
</p>
<p></p>
<h1>This girl's eyes seem to be leaning to the upper right. But she's not following anything with her eyes. </h1>
<p>
Even if she was nodding at someone, it's unclear who she was nodding at.
Is it the expression on her face when she asks her patron, a senior, "Is that thing over?"
Is it the expression on her face when she says to a girl her age who's a friend, "Isn't it?"
Or even if she was following someone with her eyes, there's no emotion behind it. Why is she smiling if she was just following a flying insect?
</p>
<h1>But if we were to explain it as "posing for the camera," there couldn't be a more fitting description.
</h1>
<p>
This girl smiled sweetly at the camera.
She was merely a "subject," and one could only say that her personality as a person was weak...
Isn't that a waste in terms of illustration?
Wasn't there more to depict?
</p>
<h1>Research into human illustrations as expressions of external pressure
</h1>
<p>
In this entry, I move away from the ambiguous representational technique commonly seen in traditional illustrations, where the "subject" simply strikes a pose and facial expression that conveys external pressure without exerting any external pressure.
Instead, I research the depiction of a kind of body language that "expresses some kind of pressure toward the viewer of the picture."
</p>
<p>
So, if this girl were aware of the person on the other side of the screen, what kind of expression would she have?
To do this, I would have to imagine that there was someone on the other side of the girl who was speaking to her.
If you find that difficult to imagine, try imagining it this way:
"If this girl were to face me, the viewer, what kind of face would she make toward me?"
</p>
<h1>Just thinking about it will significantly change the direction of the picture you're trying to draw.

</h1>
<p>
For example, how about this?

</p>
<img src="./mahou1-medium.jpg" alt="2" width="800"><br>
<p>
This is the face she makes when she notices someone in front of her and reacts, right?
This transforms the subject from being merely a subject into a "living person."
Furthermore, beyond a reflexive reaction, is there a thoughtful one?
How about this?

</p>
<img src="./mahou2-medium.jpg" alt="2" width="800"><br>
<p>
This is clearly a calculated reaction.
But it's a more formal reaction.
It makes you think, "Oh, maybe a witch teacher of higher rank has come?"
This leads to various imaginations.
This will also allow you to imagine the girl's "personality."
It's a personality that would be completely unimaginable from the girl who is merely the "subject" at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, try to create a detailed character and behavior for the person coming from the other side of the girl.
It could be yourself.
But it would be even better if you could create something more specific.

</p>
<img src="./gakusei1-medium.jpg" alt="3" width="800"><br>
<p>
This is a male student.
He's walking down the street when he bumps into the witch girl, is surprised,
and can't help but ask, "Who are you?"
</p>
<p>
What would happen if you drew the girl's reaction to this?
</p>
<img src="./mahou3-medium.jpg" alt="3" width="800"><br>
<p>
Oh no!
What a disaster!
I wrote it to convey the feeling that she's been found.
This approach makes the girl's personality seem much more "tricky."
You can also create a variety of reactions by changing the girl's personality.
This is what I call my "research into human illustrations as an expression of external pressure"!

</p>
<h1>I'll be updating my research from time to time, but what do you think?

</h1>
<p>
I hope this helps you create your own illustrations.
